# Contributing to CogniPace

Thanks for contributing. Keep changes focused, explain the user-facing reason for the work, and discuss large changes before investing heavily in implementation.

## Development Setup

- Use Node `24.x` LTS
- Use `npm`

```bash
npm install
npm run check
```

## Workflow

- Branch from `main`
- Keep one logical change per pull request
- Summarize the problem and solution clearly in the PR
- Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and the core docs for product, architecture, or process-sensitive changes

## Project Guardrails

- React 19 + MUI + Emotion are the canonical UI stack
- Keep `src/domain/*` React-free
- Keep `src/entrypoints/*` thin
- UI reads and writes should go through repositories and runtime clients, not direct `chrome.storage` access
- Keep popup, overlay, and dashboard behavior aligned with the product and architecture docs

## Validation And Review

- Run `npm run check` before opening a PR
- Update tests when behavior changes
- Include screenshots for visible popup, dashboard, or overlay changes
- Keep docs in sync with code changes

## Doc Updates

- Update [docs/product.md](docs/product.md) or [docs/features.md](docs/features.md) when behavior changes
- Update [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) when boundaries, runtime flow, or storage/message contracts change
- Update [docs/DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md](docs/DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md) when visual conventions change
- Update [requiredStepsForSetup.md](requiredStepsForSetup.md) when setup or process expectations change
